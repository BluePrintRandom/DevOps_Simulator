My setup:

In the first protoype there are 10 laptops, each running Ubuntu 20.04
they are arranged as two rows of 5 with fixed IPs assigned as 
192.168.0.201 - 204 plus 205
192.168.0.206 - 209 plus 210

Machines 205 and 210 are not part of the cluster.

The 8 laptops will host virtualbox servers - the 205 and 210 machines provide 
browsers, downloads and monitoring screens for the rest of the cluster
I use one more machine on a second group to set up and configure the cluster
environment and consolidate control using the multiport terminal "Terminator"
i.e. 
sudo apt install terminator

All the machines are set up to login without passwords via ssh keys:
on each machine run:

ssh-keygen -f "/home/$USER/.ssh/known_hosts" -R "xx.xx.xx.xx"

then connect to each machine and run:

ssh-copy-id cubespawn@192.168.0.xx

once this is done you can ssh to each machine and run 

sudo visudo

this will open /etc/sudoers.tmp

add the line:
$USER ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
to the end of the file

now bash scripts including sudo can be run from a single external terminal
to do all the setup work for your lab cluster

(This will become a set of shell scripts)
