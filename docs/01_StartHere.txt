This Repo aims to setup a working environment for a CubeSpawn Simulator, 
using the many orchestration and virtualization tools available.

Broadly, the steps I have used for the prototype are: to setup several Virtual Machines hosted on several laptops,
The next phase will be to migrate this environment to several multicore 4U servers when performance requirements merit it.

To begin, ssh keys must be generated and shared to enable secure passwordless ssh between the machines.
the included scripts will setup resources on each machine (ansible, vagrant, some vagrant plugins, docker docker-machine 

Ansible and Vagrant will bring up the VMS from the scripts in the "shell" folder , then docker, docker-machine, and rancherOS with lay a foundation for the docker containers for each service in the simulator
