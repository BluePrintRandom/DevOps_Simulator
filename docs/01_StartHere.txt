This Repo aims to setup a working environment for a CubeSpawn Simulator, 
using the many orchestration and virtualization tools available.

Broadly, the steps I have used for the prototype are: 

Setup fluid communication for scripting via ssh keys and passwordless sudo,
(Note: passwordless sudo has huge potential security implications, NOT for a production environment!)

Download and install all the required support tools on the lab hardware

Vagrant
docker-machine
Docker

Setup one virtual machine per laptop. with machine-RancherOS

Network between the containers

offer services on the LAN, without exposing them to the internet


The next phase will be to migrate this environment to several multicore 4U servers when performance requirements merit it.
